# LAPTOP-PRICE-PREDICTOR-PROJECT

# Laptop Price Predictor (Jun'23-Jul'23)
The Laptop Price Predictor is a Python-based machine learning project developed to accurately estimate laptop prices. It encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering for precise predictions. Three different algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest - have been applied, achieving an impressive accuracy of 86.51%.


# Overview ðŸ“‹
The Laptop Price Predictor project is a pioneering data-driven solution to meet the demands of modern laptop buyers seeking informed purchase decisions. By analyzing a curated dataset containing a wide array of laptop specifications and their corresponding prices, the model's input features include critical aspects such as processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, screen size, and graphics card details. Rigorous data preprocessing techniques are employed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, ensuring the model's robustness and delivering trustworthy predictions.

# Project Highlights
Data Processing and Feature Engineering: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing. Additionally, meaningful features were engineered to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

# Machine Learning Models: The project incorporates Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms. This diverse approach led to an accuracy rate of 86.51%, ensuring robust predictions.
